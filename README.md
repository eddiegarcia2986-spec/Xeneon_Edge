Corsair Xeneon Edge Widget Suite <br>
Last Updated: January 22, 2026 <br>
I am Shrouds, a project / product manager and marketer. I built this collection of widgets based on my personal usecases and tools I wanted to explore.
I am not a developer, but do have basic coding knowledge that I hope to expand and improve upon. In the end, the products I build here go through a product development process in 
developing a feature list, creating a wireframe and concept, and gathering research before using generative AI to create the code. <br>
